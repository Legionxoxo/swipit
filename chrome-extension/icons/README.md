# Extension Icons

This folder should contain the following icon files:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels) 
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

These icons will be displayed in:
- icon16.png: Extension toolbar and context menus
- icon48.png: Extensions management page
- icon128.png: Chrome Web Store and installation dialogs

For now, placeholder files can be used during development. In production, proper icons should be created with:
- Clear, recognizable design
- Consistent styling across sizes
- High contrast for visibility
- Professional appearance

The icons should represent the YouTube/Instagram downloader functionality, possibly incorporating:
- Download arrow symbol
- Video/media icons
- Platform logos (following brand guidelines)
- Chrome extension styling conventions
